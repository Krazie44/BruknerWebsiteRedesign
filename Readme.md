Name of Project: Brukner Nature Center Website Redesign

Project Overview: The attached code is for a redesign of the Brukner 
Nature Center Website. The old website contains broken links and has
an outdated style and this project is setup to alleviate some of that. 

Installation instructions: Download all files and right click on the index.html
file and open that in your web browser. Then you can surf this redesigned website
like you would any other website. All links should work both internally to the
site and externally.
